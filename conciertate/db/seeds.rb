Wolper’s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory debuted in movie theaters; based on the Roald Dahl book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Like many people of a certain age and temperament, the movie became a perennial favorite that Claypool would come back to repeatedly, throughout different stages of his life, taking something different away from it each time. \n So it seemed equal parts genius and obvious when he decided to throw a Willy Wonka-themed Primus show on New Year’s Eve last year.  During the second set, Primus performed the soundtrack in its entirety.  \"Of the 23 or so New Years shows, I don’t think we’ve ever had a better combination of elements,\" Claypool reflects, seven months later.  \"It felt good.  It felt like we needed to be doing this.\" ", tickets: "Get tickets online at <a href='http://www.axs.com/' target='_blank'> www.asx.com </a>")
